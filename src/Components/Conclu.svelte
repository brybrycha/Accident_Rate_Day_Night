      <span class="highlight">O</span>ur analysis of car accidents in Camden, UK, offers valuable insights into how time influences both the frequency and severity of road incidents. We observed distinct peaks in accident rates during the morning and evening rush hours, as well as a notable increase around midday. These findings highlight the importance of heightened vigilance during these high-traffic periods, and how that rejects our initial hypothesis. In contrary of our initial hypothesis, you are more likely to get into an accident during daytime than night time

      Contrary to our initial hypothesis, the time of day does not significantly impact the severity of accidents. The distribution of 'slight', 'serious', and 'fatal' accidents remains consistent between daytime and nighttime. This suggests that other factors, such as road conditions and driver behavior, are more critical in determining accident severity.
      <br><br>
      One takeaway from the result with visualizations is how we should not be afraid of driving during nighttime but we should be more cautious when we are driving during nighttime. Furthermore, Limited Visiblility is not the huge factors that cause traffic accidents. This result was explained by map visualization with separated nighttime and daytime accident data. You can see how daytime has more total accident counts than night time.
      <br><br>
      In conclusion, while timing does affect the likelihood of accidents, it does not drastically influence their severity. To improve road safety, a multifaceted approach addressing various factors beyond just the time of day is essential. By understanding these patterns, we can better prepare and implement strategies to reduce accidents and enhance road safety for everyone.
